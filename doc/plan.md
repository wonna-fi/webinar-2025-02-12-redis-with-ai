Below is a high-level, step-by-step plan that splits the work into narrow, complete vertical slices. Each step delivers a working “end-to-end” feature that you can test with the official Redis CLI. This plan is designed to build a simple Redis server in Go that complies with the RESP protocol, supports concurrency, and implements the required commands.

### 1. Set Up a Basic TCP Server
- **Goal:** Create a Go program that listens on port 6379 (the default Redis port) and accepts incoming connections.
- **Vertical Slice:** 
  - Implement a TCP listener.
  - For each accepted connection, spawn a new goroutine to handle client communication.
- **Outcome:** You can connect to the server with the Redis CLI and see connection logs.

### 2. Implement a Minimal RESP Parser
- **Goal:** Parse incoming data according to the RESP specification (supporting simple strings, bulk strings, integers, arrays, and errors).
- **Vertical Slice:** 
  - Write a basic parser to decode RESP messages.
  - Initially, focus on parsing simple arrays (command + arguments) that cover commands like PING.
- **Outcome:** The server correctly decodes the command input from redis-cli.

### 3. Build a Command Dispatcher with PING Support
- **Goal:** Route parsed commands to the appropriate handler.
- **Vertical Slice:** 
  - Create a dispatcher that matches command names.
  - Implement the PING command handler to return the RESP simple string "PONG".
- **Outcome:** Running `PING` from redis-cli returns "PONG", verifying end-to-end communication.

### 4. Add ECHO Command Support
- **Goal:** Extend the dispatcher to support the ECHO command.
- **Vertical Slice:** 
  - Implement the ECHO handler to return the provided argument as a bulk string.
- **Outcome:** Testing with `ECHO "Hello, Redis!"` yields the expected output.

### 5. Implement an In-Memory Key-Value Store
- **Goal:** Create a basic data store (using a Go map) for managing keys and values.
- **Vertical Slice:** 
  - Integrate the store into your command dispatcher.
  - Ensure that GET and SET commands interact with the store.
- **Outcome:** You can use `SET key value` to store data and `GET key` to retrieve it.

### 6. Add DEL Command Support
- **Goal:** Allow deletion of keys from the in-memory store.
- **Vertical Slice:** 
  - Implement the DEL handler that removes the specified key and returns the number of keys deleted.
- **Outcome:** `DEL key` removes the key and responds correctly to the client.

### 7. Introduce Concurrency-Safe Data Access
- **Goal:** Ensure the in-memory store works correctly when accessed concurrently.
- **Vertical Slice:** 
  - Wrap the key-value store with synchronization primitives (e.g., a mutex or use sync.Map).
  - Validate that simultaneous clients can perform GET/SET/DEL operations without data races.
- **Outcome:** The server remains stable and consistent under concurrent access.

### 8. Enhance RESP Compliance and Data Types
- **Goal:** Refine your RESP parser and response builders to fully support the RESP data types (including proper error formatting and integers).
- **Vertical Slice:** 
  - Review the RESP specification to handle edge cases.
  - Add tests that simulate various client commands (including those from redis-cli and redis-benchmark).
- **Outcome:** Your server’s responses fully comply with the RESP protocol as used by official tools.

### 9. Implement Additional Required Commands
- **Goal:** Ensure compatibility with redis-cli and redis-benchmark.
- **Vertical Slice:** 
  - Add support for auxiliary commands such as QUIT, and possibly INFO if needed.
  - Ensure that any commands expected by benchmarking tools return valid RESP responses.
- **Outcome:** The server is recognized as a compatible Redis-like service by both client and benchmarking tools.

### 10. Final Testing and Validation
- **Goal:** Verify that the server works end-to-end and adheres to the RESP spec.
- **Vertical Slice:** 
  - Use redis-cli to test all implemented commands.
  - Run redis-benchmark to evaluate the server’s concurrency handling and performance.
- **Outcome:** A stable, compliant lightweight Redis server that can be extended with additional features later.

This structured plan builds a foundation that is both minimal and extendable. Each vertical slice is self-contained and testable, ensuring that early integration (such as network handling and RESP parsing) is validated before more complex features (like data persistence and concurrency safety) are added.
